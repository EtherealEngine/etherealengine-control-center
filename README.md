# Ethereal Engine Control Center

Want to build the spatial web on your website? Looking for a place to start?  Run a web metaverse cluster yourself on your own computer. 

The Ethereal Engine Control Center is a self-contained Metaverse world in a box.  Take what you need or launch the full stack.  Ethereal Engine Control Center is a desktop app to manage a metaverse cluster.

We know it's been complicated to build with #EtherealEngine and we've made this tool to give the community easy access to the engine for development and creation. The full Kubernetes cluster can run on mac and any Debian Linux distro with at least 16 GB of ram.


We would love to see your creations and invite you all to come build with us.  We've got a long backlog and need your help to build the Open Metaverse.  Come build with us!

## Let's build it together

We believe that projects like this are extremely complex and difficult, and can only be built when large groups of people work together, out in the open. If you believe that your calling is to build a free, open network that everyone, everywhere can get value from, then you are welcome in our community, and we'll do our best to get you set up.

We are always hiring talented people who want to be leaders in what is to come. Inquire with anyone who seems like they know what's going on and they'll help you find who you need to talk to.
